# Post-Install Scripts for GPD Win Devices
These scripts should be able to get you up and running as quickly as possible after installing the associated distros.
## Quick Start
The script assumes you are `git clone` -ing into your user directory. Each script is named for the associated linux distro. Working on testing these more and will update soon with fixes and cleanup. Below is an example of running the Fedora script.
```bash
https://github.com/al12gamer/gpdwinlinux.git
cd gpdwinlinux
chmod +x fedora_winmax.sh
./fedora_winmax.sh
```
